virtual-visualizer
-----------
Virtual visualizer is basically a script running in raspberry pi with help of openCV and simpleCV.There are lots of devices for blind and virtually impaired people, but very few of them have multiple options at a suitable price. So the main target of our project was to develop a device that will help the blind and virtually impaired people. Our designed device is a multifunctional low cost device. It is an image processing base object detection project, uses Raspberry Pi 2 with ultrasonic sensor and USB camera. It uses image processing with ultrasonic sensor for detecting object as well as the size and shape of the objects using blob. We have implemented our project both in software side and hardware side.

Status
------
This project is a very simple image processing. Looking for other engineers/developers/analysts/hackers to invest their ideas, time and code.

virtual visualizer is written in python and aims to be cross-platform by utilizing libraries.Most development and testing is focused on x86 and x86\_64 POSIX hosts and guests.
